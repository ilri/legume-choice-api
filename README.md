# LegumeCHOICE API

This is a very simple Express.js API used to manage data submitted from the [LegumeCHOICE app](https://github.com/ilri/legume-choice-client). The data is then processed using [these Python scripts](https://github.com/ilri/legume-choice-data-processing). For a full description of the LegumeCHOICE tool, and for more details on this component, please see the [full documentation](https://legume-choice-docs.readthedocs.io/)
