# An express API for the legumeCHOICE application

This is a very simple API used to manage data submitted from the [legumeCHOICE app](https://github.com/l-gorman/legume-choice-client). The data is then processed using [these scripts](https://github.com/l-gorman/legume-choice-data-processing). For a full description of the whole legumeCHOICE tool, and for more details on this component, please see the [full documentation](https://legume-choice-docs.readthedocs.io/)
